## Other notes

* This package was previously archived due to a dependency on `timetk`. This release removes that dependency.
* The description references GPS and GPX, which show up in a spell check as "misspelled words". The former is an obvious term of art in the context of this package, and the latter is defined on first use.
* The GPX/TCX files I include as examples were recorded by me, so there's no license concerns there.

## Reverse dependencies

As the package got archived previously, it has no current reverse dependencies.
